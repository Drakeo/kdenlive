    <description><![CDATA[Debands video quickly using gradients.<br>
    Fix the banding artifacts that are sometimes introduced into nearly flat regions by truncation to 8-bit color depth.<br>
    Interpolate the gradients that should go where the bands are, and dither them.<br><br>
    <b><i>It is designed for playback only. Do not use it prior to lossy compression, because compression tends to lose the dither and bring back the bands</i></b>.]]></description>
